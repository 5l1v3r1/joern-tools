NAME

apiEmbedder.py - A tool to embed code in vector spaces

SYNOPSIS

apiEmbedder.py [options]

DESCRIPTION

embedder.py creates an embedding of functions based on the API symbols
they employ as well as a corresponding distance matrix. These
embeddings are used by knn.py to identify similar functions but may
also serve as a basis for other tools that require a vectorial
representation of code.

-d --dirname <dirname>

Output directory of the embedding. By default, output will be written
to the directory 'embedding'.
